# FitTrack – Context-Aware Mobile Application for Personalized Fitness and Nutrition

## Overview

**FitTrack** is a mobile fitness and nutrition application designed to deliver **personalized workout plans**, **nutritional recommendations**, and **interactive user engagement** through context-aware features. The app is being developed as part of the **Bachelor's thesis** by **Bolchis Răzvan** under the supervision of **Assoc. Prof. PhD. Zsigmond Imre**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is currently in active development. Only the authentication module is implemented as of now, with ongoing work on workout and nutrition tracking, social features, and wearable device integration.

## Thesis Abstract

FitTrack aims to blend real-time biometrics, adaptive exercise guidance, and nutrition planning in a seamless cross-platform mobile interface. Built using **React Native** and **Firebase**, the app leverages data from user profiles, preferences, and mobile/wearable sensors to generate tailored fitness suggestions.

Key features explored in the thesis:

- Contextual workout recommendations based on selected muscle groups
- Nutrition guidance with macro/micro breakdowns
- Integration with social challenges and community features
- Real-time adaptation via sensor data (step count, heart rate, etc.)
